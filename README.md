## ACTools: Timetracking
<p>
  This package contains pre-made time tracking objects which are extendable. It also includes two premade components which are also extendable.
  This package includes ACTools: Core as a built-in dependancy. This is because Unity does not support git dependancy in custom packages as of this version.
  <br/>
  Feel free to use it for whatever. If you wouldn't mind, please credit me. It would be appreciated!

  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess you could use a submodule as well, but I can't help you with that.</i>
  <br/>
